# Dutch Open Hackathon 2015
## Introduction
Basically the idea is that we will be a affiliate network with existing images as ads. Instead of adding
ads all over the page, we allow advertisers to choose images that are already posted by the publisher to
be linked to their products. This will mean that the advertisements are very rich, since they seamlessly
integrate with the blog's content. Publishers will earn more per click, since conversion from blogs will
be higher because the content of the blog adds value to the product that the advertiser tries to sell.

### @jeroenvisser101 – Jeroen Visser
Hi, I'm Jeroen, I'm a developer at [SEOshop](http://seoshop.com/) and have worked in eCommerce for quite
a while now. I've started programming since I was 8 years old, and have loved it ever since. At first, I
started because my father was coding too, and I really wanted to do it too. He was very willing to teach
me and that's how it all started. Now, more than 10 years later, I've learned a lot more, and still love
what programming allows you to do.
